// 1. What is the worst case complexity of the following function?

function hasDuplicates(arr) {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
//The worst-case complexity of the function is O(n2).
//where n = arr.length or simply length of the array.
//Reason:
//let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
//For outer loop i=0 inner loop runs for j=0 to j= arr.length
//For outer loop i=1 inner loop runs for j=0 to j= arr.length
//For outer loop i=2 inner loop runs for j=0 to j= arr.length
//For outer loop i=3 inner loop runs for j=0 to j= arr.length
//For outer loop i=4 inner loop runs for j=0 to j= arr.length
//after that it will return false.
//So for each iteration, the inner loops run arr.length or n times.
//So for n iterations, it takes n*n = n2 time.

// 2. Implement a faster version of the same function and analyze the
//    complexity of this approach.

function hasDuplicatesFast(arr) {
let map = {};
let cheker = false;
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
// check if object contains entry with this element as key
if(map[arr[i]]) {
checker = true;
// terminate the loop
break;
}
// add entry in object with the element as key
map[arr[i]] = true;
}
//Reason
//Declare an empty object.
//Traverse the array using a for loop.
//In every iteration, add a new entry in the object with the array element as key and any fixe value
//While doing the iteration first check the presence of current array element in object
//If an entry is already there, means that the array has duplicacy so terminate the loop.
  // todo
}

// 3. The travelling salesman problem is a another classic problem and we are
//    going to solve it using a greedy algorithm. Before starting, please read
//    through the article on Wikipedia:
//      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
//    Then implement the following:
//    (a) Create a graph that represents the example symmetric TSP problem on
//        the Wikipedia page.
//    (b) Implement a greedy search that finds the shortest path. You should
//        have the following steps: (1) pick node A as the starting position,
//        (2) pick the closest neighbor that has not been visited as the next
//        city to visit, (3) continue this process until returning to A,
//        (4) print the final length of the path and also the sequence of
//        the cities.
//    (c) Check your results, do they make sense? Is is the optimal solution?

If size of S is 2, then S must be {1, i},
 C(S, i) = dist(1, i)
Else if size of S is greater than 2.
 C(S, i) = min { C(S-{i}, j) + dis(j, i)} where j belongs to S, j != i and j != 1.
// For a set of size n, we consider n-2 subsets each of size n-1 such that all subsets donâ€™t have nth in them.
//Using the above recurrence relation, we can write dynamic programming based solution. There are at most O(n*2n)
//subproblems, and each one takes linear time to solve. The total running time is therefore O(n2*2n). The time
//complexity is much less than O(n!), but still exponential. Space required is also exponential. So this approach
//is also infeasible even for slightly higher number of vertices.

// 4. Solve https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/intersecting-rectangles/
//    What is the runtime complexity of your solution?
//    HINT: Try to break down the problems into smaller steps. For example,
//          find a convenient way to represent rectangles and define a function
//          that tests whether one rectangle is inside another. Then test your
//          code on just two rectangles first to make sure it works.
